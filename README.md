# Java Option Pricing Models

This repository contains **three separate Java projects** for pricing options using different methods:

1. **BinomialTreeOptionPricing**
2. **Black-Scholes**
3. **MonteCarloOptionPricing**

Each subdirectory has its own Maven configuration (`pom.xml`), source files, and README detailing how to build and run that specific model.
